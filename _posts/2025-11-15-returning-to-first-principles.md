I didn’t start using first principles because it sounded smart. I used it because life got noisy, and the usual routines stopped working. You know that moment when everything feels off, but nothing is technically wrong? That was me. So I did the one thing most people avoid: I tore everything down to the studs.

## When Things Stop Adding Up

I kept catching myself saying things like “this is how it’s supposed to be” or “it worked before.” Those lines are basically autopilot. Comfortable, but not useful.

So I reset. Not dramatically. Just honestly.

I asked myself the questions I’d been dodging:

- What am I really trying to solve?  
- What outcome actually matters to me?  
- Which limitations are real, and which ones did I just accept because they were familiar?

It’s uncomfortable at first, but it’s also freeing. Once you challenge assumptions, you see how many of them never needed to be there.

## How I Broke Things Down

I took one decision that had been draining me and rebuilt it from zero.

1. I wrote down the real goal, not the polite one.  
2. I listed every assumption behind the way I was approaching it.  
3. I crossed out anything that was just inherited thinking.  
4. I built a new plan starting from the raw facts.

It wasn’t some clean “framework.” It felt more like taking apart a machine while hoping you remember how to put it back. But the clarity hit fast.

### The Unexpected Benefit

When you strip decisions down to fundamentals, things get quieter. The internal noise drops. The second-guessing slows down. You stop weighing other people’s opinions like they’re laws of physics.

## Using First Principles Day to Day

You don’t need a crisis for this stuff. I use it now for simple choices too:

- What to prioritize  
- What inputs to ignore  
- Whether a routine is still earning its keep  
- What goals actually matter versus what I’m “supposed” to care about  

The point isn’t to optimize life. It’s to see it clearly.

## What This Taught Me

Starting from first principles didn’t magically make things simple. It just made things honest. And once something is honest, you can work with it.

### Key Takeaways

- Most assumptions don’t survive contact with the truth.  
- Rebuilding from scratch is annoying but worth it.  
- Clarity feels quiet.  
- First principles thinking isn’t a philosophy exercise. It’s a reset button.

Feels right that this is the first post here. If I’m going to write publicly, I might as well start with the thing that helped me get unstuck.
