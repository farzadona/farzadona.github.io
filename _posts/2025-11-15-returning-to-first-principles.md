I didn’t learn first principles from a physics textbook or a startup founder. Mine came from a quieter place: the moment when every plan I thought I understood stopped making sense. Nothing dramatic. Just one of those years where every assumption feels like it got mispriced.

So I did what most people avoid because it sounds annoyingly abstract. I took everything apart.

## Why First Principles Hit Harder When Life Gets Messy

It’s easy to memorize “reduce things to basics.” It’s harder to realize how many of your decisions are built on habits, inherited beliefs, or whatever the last person you spoke to convinced you made sense.

> Assumptions are comfortable until they cost you momentum.

For me, the wake-up call was noticing how often I justified choices using phrases like “that’s just how it’s done” or “it worked last time.” Those are shortcuts masquerading as logic.

First principles gave me permission to scrap everything and ask the real questions:

- What problem am I actually trying to solve?  
- What outcome matters, not the one that’s socially acceptable to want?  
- What constraints are real, and which ones did I hallucinate?

## Breaking Things Down Without Breaking Yourself

I started with one decision that had been draining me for months. Instead of adding more data, I subtracted.

1. Defined the core goal in one sentence.  
2. Listed every assumption behind the way I was pursuing it.  
3. Crossed out the ones that were just stories.  
4. Rebuilt the decision path from scratch.

It wasn’t elegant. It felt like pulling wires out of a wall you definitely didn’t build. But there’s a weird confidence that comes from understanding the base layer of your own thinking.

### The Surprising Upside: You Get Quieter Inside

When you cut decisions down to fundamentals, the noise drops. You stop ricocheting between opinions, trends, and anxieties because you’re anchored in something sturdier than vibes.

That alone was worth the effort.

## Applying First Principles to Everyday Life

You don’t need a crisis to use this model. It works just as well on small, boring dilemmas:

- Choosing what to focus on next  
- Filtering your inputs  
- Deciding which goals are actually yours  
- Evaluating whether a routine still serves its purpose  

It’s not about efficiency. It’s about honesty.

## What I Learned From Starting Over

First principles didn’t magically simplify life. They just made the complexity visible instead of chaotic. And once you can see something clearly, you can work with it.

### Key Takeaways

- Strip decisions down until the real problem becomes obvious.  
- Beware of inherited assumptions disguised as common sense.  
- Rebuilding from zero is slower but dramatically cleaner.  
- The model isn’t academic; it’s deeply personal when applied honestly.

Starting this blog with a post about first principles is fitting. Everything worth doing starts with asking what’s actually true, not what’s convenient.
